# Automate Ground Truth Labeling for point cloud
## Track and Label Bounding Box(Cuboid) Automatically Based on predefined Bounding Box

Deep Learning is really powerful approach to classify objects from point cloud. Good ground truth data is crucial for training deep neural network for classification. However, creating and maintaining a diverse and high-quality set of annotated data requires significant effort. The groundTruthLabeler and makes this process easy and efficient and this semi-automation algorithm can be used with groundTruthLabeler to help you to label cuboids. This automatetion algorithms uses automatic clustering and tracking algorithms which create labels for all frames automatically based on labels manually defined for just first frame.
